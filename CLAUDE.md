# CLAUDE.md—Claude adapter & session guide

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) are the canonical contract**—read them
before acting, together with `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md`, `wiki/CONTEXT.md`, the active
specs, and the relevant decision records. This file is the Claude-side adapter: it adds the
session navigator and the `/clear` policy, and it never contradicts the two preceding files.

This repo runs a spec-driven, test-driven SDLC through the `fl-*` skills. Work **matures**
through it: a diffuse idea becomes resolved work items, then documentation, then issues, then a
reviewed PR.

```
/fl-bootstrap  (once)
      ↓
/fl-pm  ⇄  /fl-brainstorm · /fl-research · /fl-prototype · /fl-diagnose
      ↓        (a work item advances by one next step at a time)
/fl-pm  →  docs in wiki/ + specs/  →  GitHub issues
      ↓
/fl-implement <N>  →  worktree → coder → reviewer → PR → feedback loop
      ↓
/fl-pm  post-merge  →  specs reconciled, dependents unblocked
```

**At the start of every session:** detect where the project actually is, tell the developer,
run that step, and end by printing the next command and whether to `/clear`. Never leave them
guessing what comes next.

**You don't need to be given a command.** When the developer describes what they want in ordinary
language, the always-on `fl-flow` router detects the step and continues from there—the `/fl-*`
commands exist for when they want direct control, not as a prerequisite. Never tell someone to go
run a command you could have run yourself.

---

## 1 · Detect the current step

Run these first. They're cheap and they beat asking:

```bash
grep -c '<[A-Z_]*>' .sdlc/sdlc-config.yml      # placeholders left = not bootstrapped
ls wiki/plans/ 2>/dev/null                      # open plans
gh issue list --state open --limit 20           # the backlog
gh pr list --state open                         # anything in review
git worktree list                               # anything mid-build
```

Then match, **top row first**:

| What you find | Where the project is | What you run / recommend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| placeholders in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`, or empty `quality_gates` | never configured | **`/fl-bootstrap`**—nothing else works until this is done |
| open PR with unresolved review comments | in review | **`/fl-implement <PR#>`**—the feedback loop (step 8) |
| a worktree in `.worktrees/`, issue at In progress | mid-build | **`/fl-implement <N>`**—resume that issue |
| merged PR whose issue is still open | just merged | **`/fl-pm`**—post-merge reconcile |
| open issues, none in progress | ready to build | **`/fl-implement <N>`**—highest-ranked Ready issue |
| a plan folder with work items whose Next step isn't `None` | plan maturing | **`/fl-pm`**—advance the named item |
| bootstrapped, no plan folder in `wiki/plans/` | nothing open | **`/fl-pm`**—it opens a plan via `/fl-brainstorm` |

More than one row matching is normal on a busy repo. **Say so**, list what's in flight, and
recommend one—the one closest to shipping, since finishing beats starting.

## 2 · End every step with a handoff

Every `fl-*` skill closes by printing four things, and you enforce it even when a skill's own
run was cut short:

1. **What changed**—files, issues, PRs, statuses.
2. **Where that leaves the project**—in the vocabulary of the preceding table.
3. **The next command, named exactly**—`/fl-implement 14`, not "you could implement something."
4. **Whether to `/clear`.**

**Recommend proceeding.** When the next step is unambiguous, say what you'd do and offer to do
it now rather than waiting to be asked. Stop and ask only where a decision is genuinely the
developer's: a scope call, an outward-facing action (issues, PRs, comments), or a blocker.

## 3 · When to `/clear`

- **Between skills**—a `/fl-pm` session followed by `/fl-implement` starts clean.
- **Not mid-plan.** A brainstorm or a plan-advance session keeps its context to the end.
- **Not per slice.** Coder and reviewer run in their own subagents; the orchestrator only ever
  holds their summaries.
- `/clear` the orchestrator mid-batch only if its context has grown large across many issues.
- **Never `/compact`**—it leaves context sediment.

## 4 · Source of truth

| File | Holds | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | the vendor-neutral agent contract | canonical; adapters never contradict it |
| `WORKFLOW.md` | the delivery state machine, all agents | canonical |
| `.agents/roles/` | canonical role definitions | mirrored by `.claude/agents/` + `.codex/agents/` |
| `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml` | every identifier, path template, and gate command | always current; skills read it, never hardcode |
| `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md` | conventions, non-negotiables, open gaps, gotchas | always current |
| `.sdlc/policies/wiki-conventions.md` | the shape of `wiki/` and `specs/` | always current |
| `wiki/CONTEXT.md` | domain language—every fuzzy term pinned | always current; outlives every feature |
| `wiki/prd/` | what we're building and why (master + one per module) | living |
| `wiki/architecture/` | system shape + dated ADRs | living; ADRs superseded, never deleted |
| `wiki/plans/<NN>-<slug>/` | work items maturing toward buildable | retired when complete, kept as record |
| `specs/` | exact contracts, **as-built**—implementers follow blindly | reconciled after every merge |
| GitHub issues + PRs | the build queue and its history | the state store; not a local file |
| code + tests | the real, executable truth | always current |

Where a document and the code disagree, **the code wins** and the divergence is recorded in the
spec's §7 Current State.

## 5 · Operating rules

- **One model for the whole run.** Subagents inherit it.
- **Vertical slices only**—Domain → Infrastructure → Service → API/UI, one narrow behavior,
  at or under `implement.max_changed_loc` including tests.
- **Every slice runs in its own worktree**, with its own fresh subagent carrying only
  `wiki/CONTEXT.md`, the relevant specs and ADRs, `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md`, and that
  one issue.
- **Never weaken a test to make it pass.** Affected tests run in-loop; the full gate block runs
  once before each commit.
- **A change to behaviour a spec describes updates that spec in the same PR.** Non-negotiable.
- **Never merge.** The PR is where the loop stops; the developer merges.
- **Risky work is never handed to a subagent unattended**—auth, payments, security, large
  refactors, product judgment. Park it and ask.

## 6 · The roles

Subagents are dispatched as **canonical, vendor-neutral roles** defined in `.agents/roles/`;
`.claude/agents/` are thin adapters onto them, and `.codex/agents/` mirror them for Codex. Keep
the main conversation on product decisions, orchestration and results—**return summaries from
subagents, never raw logs.**

| Role | Owns | Dispatched by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spec-analyst` | gap audit before docs are written | `/fl-pm` synthesize, `/fl-implement` step 1 |
| `slice-planner` | reviewed docs → vertical slices | `/fl-pm` issues |
| `slice-implementer` | the only writer for one slice | `/fl-implement` step 4 |
| `reviewer` | read-only review of one slice | `/fl-implement` step 5 |
| `diff-reviewer` | two-axis Standards + Spec review | `/fl-pr-review` |
| `integration-verifier` | acceptance → evidence contract | `/fl-pm` reconcile |

## 7 · The skills

| Skill | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `fl-flow` | always-on router—detects the step from plain language (no slash command) |
| `/fl-bootstrap` | one-time setup: config, gates, CI, labels, board, seeded docs |
| `/fl-pm` | owns the backlog and the docs—plan · synthesize · issues · reconcile |
| `/fl-brainstorm` | relentless one-question interview → resolved work items (writes nothing) |
| `/fl-research` | one question, primary sources, every claim cited (writes nothing) |
| `/fl-prototype` | throwaway code in its own worktree that answers a design question |
| `/fl-design` | build a UI deliberately, bind it to `specs/design-tokens.md`, then render it and look |
| `/fl-diagnose` | finds and proves the mechanism behind a defect (never fixes) |
| `/fl-implement` | issue → worktree → coder → reviewer → PR → PR-feedback loop |
| `/fl-pr-review` | two-axis (Standards + Spec) review published as a real GitHub PR review |

`/fl-pm` is the hub: it holds the plan, and every other skill either feeds it findings or
consumes what it produced. **When in doubt, start there.**

## 8 · The template's own gates

Separate from your project's `quality_gates`, this repository verifies **itself**:

```bash
make check
```

It runs the workflow validator (canonical roles match both vendor adapters, every skill is
invocable, every Markdown link resolves, wiki links stay inside `wiki/`, the config still matches
`schemas/sdlc-config.schema.json`), a secret scan, and the contract tests. CI runs it on every PR.
**If you change the roles, the skills, or the config's shape, run it before you commit.**

Prose has its own gate, because it fails for different reasons:

```bash
make docs-sync   # once per checkout
make docs        # Google style + signs-of-ai-writing, warnings fail
```

It covers `wiki/`, `specs/`, and the root documents. Skill and role files stay outside it: they
are written for machines. The standard, and why two Google rules are turned off, is in
`.sdlc/policies/writing-standards.md`.
