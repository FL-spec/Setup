Clone this, rename it, and you start every project on the same rails: a disciplined flow that
takes a diffuse idea through design, documentation, and buildable issues to reviewed pull
requests—with AI doing the heavy lifting and you keeping every decision that matters.

## How we develop

Work **matures**. It doesn't get pushed through a pipeline.

```
/fl-bootstrap  (once per repo)
      ↓
/fl-pm  ⇄  /fl-brainstorm · /fl-research · /fl-prototype · /fl-diagnose
      ↓        one work item, one next step at a time
/fl-pm  →  docs in wiki/ + specs/  →  GitHub issues
      ↓
/fl-implement <N>  →  worktree → coder → reviewer → PR → feedback loop
      ↓
/fl-pm  post-merge  →  specs reconciled, dependents unblocked
```

A plan is a set of **work items sharing one goal**, each carrying exactly one **next step** from
a fixed vocabulary—brainstorm, research, prototype, diagnose, decide, write-document,
create-issues, implement. `/fl-pm` picks the next step by asking what the item actually *lacks*,
dispatches it, records what comes back, and then re-reads **every other item** in light of it.
That last part is what keeps a plan coherent instead of a set of parallel monologues.

| Phase | Command | Human-in-the-loop? | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0. Configure** | `/fl-bootstrap` | Yes | a wired repo: config, gates, CI, labels, board, seeded docs |
| **1. Shape** | `/fl-pm` → `/fl-brainstorm` | Yes | a plan of resolved work items |
| **2. Learn** | `/fl-research` · `/fl-prototype` · `/fl-diagnose` | Partly | cited facts, verdicts, proven mechanisms |
| **3. Document** | `/fl-pm` synthesize | Review gate | PRDs, specs, ADRs/FDRs—**then it stops** |
| **4. Slice** | `/fl-pm` issues | Your go-ahead | vertical-slice issues, ≤300 LOC, dependency-linked |
| **5. Build** | `/fl-implement <N>` | Only for risky slices | a reviewed PR that closes the issue |
| **6. Reconcile** | `/fl-pm` post-merge | No | specs updated, dependents unblocked |

### Why it's built this way

- **Think with a human, build with agents.** Judgment lives in phases 1–4. Once an issue exists,
  `/fl-implement` runs a coder subagent and a read-only reviewer subagent (up to three rounds)
  and stops at a PR. **It never merges.**
- **Spec before code, as-built after.** `specs/` holds exact contracts implementers follow
  blindly. Where the code and a spec disagree, **the code wins** and the divergence is recorded.
  A PR that changes behaviour a spec describes updates that spec *in the same PR*—a spec that
  lags a merge is worse than no spec, because the next implementer trusts it.
- **Two separate gates before outward state.** Documentation gets written, then **you read it**,
  then issues get cut. Issues created from unreviewed docs are state you never agreed to.
- **Vertical tracer-bullet slices.** Domain → Infrastructure → Service → API/UI for one narrow
  behavior, capped at 300 changed lines including tests, with named strategies for splitting
  anything bigger.
- **Context isolation.** Every slice runs in its own worktree, in a fresh subagent carrying only
  the glossary, the relevant specs and ADRs, the coding standards, and that one issue. The
  orchestrator keeps only the returned summaries—no context rot.
- **Test-driven, always.** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR through the public interface. Tests are never
  weakened to pass; the gates run once before every commit.
- **Decisions are durable and dated.** Business calls become FDRs. Technology and structure
  calls become ADRs. Superseded, never deleted.
- **GitHub is the state store.** Issues, sub-issues, PRs and review threads—not a local
  progress file that goes stale the moment two sessions run at once.
- **Cross-agent by construction.** `AGENTS.md` and `WORKFLOW.md` are the canonical contract, and
  the six roles in `.agents/roles/` are vendor-neutral. `.claude/agents/` and `.codex/agents/` are
  thin adapters, so Claude and Codex run the same lifecycle—and `make check` fails if they ever
  drift apart.
- **Commands are optional.** The always-on `fl-flow` router detects the step from plain language;
  the `/fl-*` commands are there when you want direct control, not as a prerequisite.
- **The template verifies itself.** `make check` validates that the roles match their adapters,
  every skill is invocable, every Markdown link resolves, wiki links survive the mirror, and the
  config still matches its JSON Schema. CI runs it on every PR.
- **Prose is a gate, not a preference.** `make docs` runs [Vale](https://vale.sh/) over the
  documentation with Google's developer style guide and the `signs-of-ai-writing` rule set, built
  from Wikipedia's *Signs of AI Writing*. Warnings fail. It catches hedging clusters, enumeration
  tics, contrastive "not just X, it's Y" phrasing, and chatbot paste artifacts, which makes
  "reads like a person wrote it" checkable rather than a matter of taste. It lints the agent's
  output and yours identically.
- **Design is a contract.** `/fl-design` carries a deliberate-by-default design standard and binds
  it to `specs/design-tokens.md`, so the palette and type scale outlive the session that chose
  them. A UI slice is not done until someone rendered it and looked at it, at 375px, in both
  themes, with real data.

## Set up a project

### Prerequisites

| You need | Because |
| --- | --- |
| `gh`, authenticated | issues and pull requests are the state store |
| Python 3.11+ | the template's own gates (`make check`). `make install-dev` adds the two libraries that turn on deep config validation |
| [Vale](https://vale.sh/) | the prose gate (`make docs`). It downloads its rule packages on first run, `make docs-sync` refreshes them, and CI installs it for you |
| `read:project` and `write:project` | only for the project board: `gh auth refresh -s read:project,write:project`. Without a board, set `github.project.enabled: false` and the flow runs on issue state alone |

### 1 · Create the repository

```bash
gh repo create my-project --private --template FL-spec/Setup --clone
cd my-project
claude
```

### 2 · Bootstrap it once

```
/fl-bootstrap
```

One interview covers the stack, the modules, and the conventions, and what comes out of it is a
repository wired end to end:

| Bootstrap produces | Where it lands |
| --- | --- |
| identifiers, path templates, and gate commands | `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`, validated against `schemas/sdlc-config.schema.json` |
| language conventions and non-negotiables | `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md` |
| the quality gates, **verified by running them** | the config, then `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| issue labels and a five-status project board | GitHub |
| documentation seeded with your real module names | `wiki/`, `specs/` |

Every skill reads that config rather than hardcoding a path or a command, so the flow follows your
project's conventions instead of the template's defaults. Nothing else runs until bootstrap
finishes.

**The board arrives provisioned, with nothing to click.** A new GitHub project ships three
statuses and this flow needs five—Backlog, Ready, In progress, In review, Done—so bootstrap
derives the project, field, and option ids and writes the missing statuses through GraphQL. That
mutation replaces a single-select field's whole option set instead of appending to it, so bootstrap
resends the existing options with their ids and stops rather than reshuffling a board that already
holds items. [HOW_WE_BUILD.md](HOW_WE_BUILD.md) has the detail.

### 3 · Open the first plan

```
/fl-pm
```

With nothing open, `/fl-pm` runs a brainstorm and writes the result to
`wiki/plans/<NN>-<slug>/`. From there the preceding phases carry the work to a reviewed pull
request.

### Every session after that

Claude reads `CLAUDE.md`, works out where the project actually is—from the config, the plan
folders, open issues, open pull requests, and live worktrees—tells you, runs that step, and closes
by printing the next command and whether to `/clear`. Describing what you want in plain language
does the same thing: the always-on `fl-flow` router detects the step and continues from there.

> Mark this repo as a template once: **Settings → Template repository** on GitHub, or
> `gh repo edit FL-spec/Setup --template`.

## Work from your phone

This repo ships with a [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) that pre-installs Claude
Code and Codex in every GitHub Codespace, alongside `gh` and the Node, Python, and Rust
toolchains. You can drive the whole flow from a phone browser, with no PC left running. See
**[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

## Verify the template itself

Separate from your project's quality gates, this repository checks itself:

```bash
make check
```

The workflow validator confirms that the canonical roles match both vendor adapters, every skill is
invocable, every Markdown link resolves, wiki links stay inside `wiki/`, and the config still
matches its JSON Schema. It then scans for secrets and runs the contract tests. CI runs the same
gate on every pull request, and you should run it after changing the roles, the skills, or the
shape of the config.

Prose has its own gate, because it fails for different reasons:

```bash
make docs             # Google style + signs-of-ai-writing, warnings fail
make docs-suggestions # advisory: everything the gate let through
```
