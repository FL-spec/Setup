# Working from your phone (GitHub Codespaces)

This repo includes a dev container ([.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json))
that automatically installs **Claude Code** in every Codespace, alongside the `gh` CLI and the
Node, Python and Rust toolchains. No PC needs to stay running.

## First time

1. Open the repo on GitHub.
2. Tap the green **Code** button → **Codespaces** tab → **Create codespace on main**.
3. Wait for the dev container to build (it installs Claude Code on first create).
4. In the Codespace terminal:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

5. Follow the login prompt to authenticate Claude Code (one-time, opens in the browser).
6. On a brand-new project, run `/fl-bootstrap` first. On an existing one, just say hello —
   Claude reads `CLAUDE.md`, detects where the project is, and tells you what to run.

## GitHub access

The `fl-*` flow is GitHub-native, so `gh` needs to be authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

A Codespace usually inherits a token with `repo` scope, which covers issues and pull requests —
everything except the project board. If you use a board:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s read:project,write:project
```

If you'd rather not, set `github.project.enabled: false` in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`. The flow
works from issue state alone; only the board moves are skipped.

## The wiki mirror

`wiki/` is mirrored to the repo's GitHub Wiki by `.github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml` on every push
to `main` that touches it. **The wiki has to be initialized once by hand** — open the repo's
**Wiki** tab and create any page — or the first sync run fails because the wiki repository
doesn't exist yet.

Don't edit pages in the GitHub Wiki UI: it's a mirror, and the next sync overwrites them. Edit
`wiki/` in the repo.

## Day to day

- Reopen your existing Codespace from https://github.com/codespaces (faster than creating one).
- Run `claude` and work as normal.
- Worktrees created by `/fl-implement` live in `.worktrees/` and are gitignored.
- Commit and push when done:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "your message"
  git push
  ```

## Tips

- **Phone browser:** the Codespaces web editor works in mobile Safari/Chrome. Request the desktop
  site for a better terminal experience.
- **Stop when idle:** Codespaces bill by usage. Stop yours from https://github.com/codespaces
  when you're done. Stopped Codespaces keep your files; they just don't run.
- **If Claude Code isn't found** after opening a Codespace, install it manually:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```
