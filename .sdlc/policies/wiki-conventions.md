# Wiki conventions

The concrete shape of `wiki/` and `specs/`, referenced by `fl-pm` rather than hardcoded into
its workflow files — this is the single source of truth for the structure itself.

## Layout

```
wiki/
  Home.md                     nav landing page
  _Sidebar.md                 nav — the wiki's only other navigation surface
  CONTEXT.md                  domain language — every fuzzy term pinned
  prd/
    00-master-prd.md          vision, cross-module scope, links to every child PRD
    <module>.md               child PRD — one per module in Module skeleton below
    decisions/                Functional Decision Records (FDRs), dated
  architecture/
    00-architecture.md        the one architecture document — system shape, module boundaries
    decisions/                Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), dated
  plans/                      fl-pm's plan-folder mechanism — see fl-pm/plan.md
  reports/                    point-in-time review reports
specs/                        (top-level, not under wiki/) — exact technical contracts
  00-contracts.md             every contract held between two or more modules
  <module>.md                 one per module
```

## Module skeleton

One child PRD and one spec file per module listed in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`'s `modules:` —
matching the repo's actual top-level directories. A **new top-level module** gets a new child
PRD and a new spec; a sub-capability *within* an existing module does not.

## File templates

**`prd/00-master-prd.md`**: Vision & Goals / Actors / Cross-Module Scope (in/out) / Success
Criteria / Links to child PRDs / Open Questions.

**`prd/<module>.md`**: Problem & Context / Actors & Goals / Functional Requirements (numbered) /
Business Rules / Decisions (links into `prd/decisions/`) / Non-Goals / Open Questions.

**`architecture/00-architecture.md`**: System overview / Module boundaries (links to
`specs/00-contracts.md` and each `specs/<module>.md`) / Cross-cutting concerns / Decisions
(links into `architecture/decisions/`) / Open Questions.

**`CONTEXT.md`**: the glossary. Every fuzzy term gets pinned the moment it appears in a
brainstorm, with the thing it is commonly confused with named explicitly. It is loaded into
every coder and reviewer subagent and it outlives any single feature.

## Decisions live next to what they decide

- A **functional** decision (a business rule, a scope call) → `wiki/prd/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
  (FDR: Context / Decision / Consequences).
- An **architecture** decision (a technology or structural choice) →
  `wiki/architecture/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (ADR: same shape).
- Write one only for decisions that are **hard to reverse, surprising, and a real trade-off**.
  Everyday choices don't need one.
- **Never delete a decision record.** A superseded one is marked
  `Superseded by [YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>]` and stays.
- Dates are absolute in every document, never relative.

## Technical contracts stay in `specs/`

`specs/` is the exact-contract layer — schemas, interfaces, file formats — that implementers
follow **blindly**. One file per module, plus the one cross-module file below, each keeping a
`Current State` section reconciled after every merge (see `fl-pm/reconcile.md`).

**`specs/00-contracts.md`** owns every contract that is bilateral or wider — held between two
or more modules, where filing it under one module's spec would wrongly imply that module owns
it: shared message envelopes, event vocabularies, cross-module key grammars, lifecycle state
machines, shared definitions. A module spec cites `00-contracts.md` by section id (`§C3`, `§C4`);
it never restates its content.

Every spec follows one skeleton:

```
1. Purpose & boundary      — what the module owns; explicitly what it must not do
2. External surface        — the exact contract, module-shaped
3. Consumed & produced contracts — pointers into specs/00-contracts.md, not restatements
4. Invariants              — numbered and module-prefixed (WEB-INV-1, API-INV-1, CTR-INV-1),
                             each individually testable
5. Configuration           — env vars, ports, defaults
6. Decisions               — links to the ADRs that bear on the module
7. Current State           — every divergence, defect and surprise
```

Specs describe the system **as-built, never as-intended** — where code and design intent
differ, the code wins and the divergence goes in §7 with an ADR recording it. The body says
what the contract *is*, with short inline pointers (`(unreachable — see §7)`) rather than
caveats scattered through it.

## Links

Relative Markdown links, **with** the `.md` extension — `[the FDR](../decisions/2026-08-17-slug.md)`.
Never root-absolute (`/prd/...` leaves GitHub entirely) and never extensionless. This follows
from `wiki_sync` in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`: `.github/scripts/flatten_wiki.py` rewrites these
for the mirrored GitHub Wiki (which has no directories in its URL space) — your job is only to
make them resolve on disk in `wiki/`.

**Never link out of `wiki/` with a relative path.** `flatten_wiki.py` only rewrites links that
resolve *inside* `wiki/`, so a `../../specs/api.md` survives into the mirrored wiki as a link to
nothing. Refer to `specs/` and other top-level paths as **code spans** (`` `specs/api.md` ``), or
use a full `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/specs/api.md` URL when the reader
genuinely needs to click through.

## Ownership

`wiki/_Sidebar.md` and `wiki/Home.md` are the wiki's only navigation. A new PRD, FDR, ADR,
plan, or report **is not finished until it is listed there**.
