# Agent contract

The durable, **vendor-neutral** instruction set for every coding agent in this repository.
`.claude/` and `.codex/` are adapters onto this file and `WORKFLOW.md`; they never redefine them.

## Read first

1. Current human instruction
2. `WORKFLOW.md` — the canonical delivery state machine
3. `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml` — every identifier, path template and gate command
4. `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md` — how code gets written here
5. `wiki/CONTEXT.md` — the domain glossary; use these words exactly
6. The active `specs/<module>.md`, plus `specs/00-contracts.md` for anything crossing a boundary
7. Relevant decision records under `wiki/architecture/decisions/` and `wiki/prd/decisions/`
8. The active plan under `wiki/plans/<NN>-<slug>/`

Higher items override lower ones. **Stop when a material conflict cannot be resolved from this
hierarchy** — don't pick a side silently.

Where a document and the code disagree, **the code wins**, and the divergence is recorded in the
spec's §7 Current State.

## Conversation-first behavior

When asked to plan or build something, inspect the repository and work out what step the project
is actually on (`CLAUDE.md` holds the detection table), then continue from there. Open or resume
the plan yourself, interview the human one material decision at a time, and write what gets
resolved into the plan.

**Never ask the human to run a workflow command, create internal files, or repeat the same intent
in a second prompt.** The explicit `/fl-*` commands exist for when they want direct control; they
are never a prerequisite.

## Delivery rules

- One issue is one branch and one PR — or, in batch mode, one ordered set of issues sharing one
  branch and one PR.
- One coherent commit per completed vertical slice.
- **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** for every behavior change.
- A bug fix starts with a reproducing test.
- **Exactly one writer owns a slice.** Parallel writers require independent, non-overlapping file
  surfaces.
- A **separate read-only reviewer** checks every slice. Implementers never approve their own work.
- Never weaken, skip, or delete a test to make a gate pass.
- **A change to behaviour a spec describes updates that spec in the same PR.**
- Never merge failing checks or bypass branch protection.
- **Never merge on the human's behalf.** The PR is where automation stops.
- Never deploy, expose credentials, or perform destructive external actions without separate
  authority.

## Two gates before outward state

Issues, pull requests, review comments and repository settings are **outward-facing**. Two of them
are gated by the human explicitly, always:

1. Documentation is written, then **the human reads it**, and only then are issues created.
2. A PR opens, and only the human merges it.

Never collapse either gate because the next step "looks obvious".

## Agent roles

Canonical responsibilities live under `.agents/roles/`:

- `spec-analyst` — gap audit before documentation is written
- `slice-planner` — reviewed docs → dependency-aware vertical slices
- `slice-implementer` — the only writer for one slice
- `reviewer` — read-only review of one slice
- `diff-reviewer` — two-axis Standards + Spec review of a diff
- `integration-verifier` — acceptance-to-evidence completion contract

There is deliberately no separate test-architect: the slice implementer owns its own first failing
test. Add security or AI-evaluation specialists when the project needs them.

## Project commands

Every runnable command lives under `quality_gates` in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`, **per module**.
Take them verbatim from that file rather than from memory — it is what CI runs and what the
reviewer checks. A gate whose command is a `TODO` placeholder is reported as such, never as passed.

Template contract (this repository's own gates, independent of your stack):

- Validate the workflow: `python3 scripts/validate_workflow.py`
- Scan for secrets: `python3 scripts/scan_secrets.py`
- Contract tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"`
- All three: `make check`

`/fl-bootstrap` replaces the project placeholders and makes CI execute the real stack gates.

## Security and dependencies

- **Never commit secrets or customer data.** Env vars or gitignored config only.
- Treat external input and model output as **untrusted**.
- Validate the environment at startup.
- **Ask before adding a dependency**; pin and review it, and document material additions in the PR.
- Use least-privilege CI permissions.

## Completion contract

A unit of work is complete only when:

- the documentation it implements was reviewed by the human and is materially unchanged;
- every acceptance criterion has passing evidence — **agent confidence is not evidence**;
- focused and full gates pass for every module touched, plus `make check`;
- independent review has no blocker;
- every spec whose described behaviour changed was updated in the same PR;
- cross-module contracts and the architecture document were checked explicitly;
- rollout, rollback, migrations, observability and docs are addressed;
- remote PR checks are green;
- the PR is open and the human has been told it is ready.

Then report the outcome and **stop**. Do not invent follow-up work.

## Mandatory escalation

Set state `blocked` and ask **one precise question** for: unresolved product behavior,
permissions, credentials, compliance, destructive changes, branch protection, or the same root
failure after **three repairs**. Preserve the branch, the PR, and the durable state.

**Never silently reduce scope.**

## Gotchas

Repository-specific lessons are appended to `.sdlc/policies/coding-standards.md`, not here — that
file is what every subagent brief loads.
