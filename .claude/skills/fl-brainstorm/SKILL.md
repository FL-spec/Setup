name: fl-brainstorm
description: >
  Relentless one-question-at-a-time interview that takes a diffuse idea to a set of resolved
  work items sharing one goal. Use when the user wants to open or shape a plan, stress-test a
  design or decision, asks to be grilled, or a fl-pm plan work item's next step is a brainstorm.

# Brainstorm

Interview the user **relentlessly** until the shared understanding is confirmed and the idea
has resolved into work items. You walk one decision branch at a time; **you write no files.**
What you return goes to `/fl-pm`, which records it.

## Ground rules

- **One question at a time.** Give your **recommended answer first**, then ask the user to
  confirm, correct, or choose an alternative. A question that offers no recommendation makes
  the user do your thinking.
- The user answers **Yes** (locked, move on), **No** (wrong — discard and re-ask), or
  **Almost** (close — refine until it's a Yes).
- **Look before you ask.** Check whether the answer already sits in nearby code,
  `wiki/CONTEXT.md`, `wiki/`, `specs/`, or the plan's own detail files. Ask the user where to
  look only when the context isn't discoverable.
- **Pin the language as you go.** The moment a fuzzy term appears — "account", "job", "run" —
  ask which thing it means and what it's *not* to be confused with. Carry the pinned terms in
  your report; `/fl-pm` writes them to `wiki/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Relentless means every branch.** Continue until the user has confirmed each open branch —
  including the ones that surfaced mid-session. A branch left unasked becomes a surprise
  during implementation.
- **No architecture, no file paths, no code.** This is design, not implementation.

## Two entry points

**Opening a plan** — the idea is diffuse and the goal is what you're establishing. Drive
toward the goal first, then toward the work items that serve it.

**Advancing one work item** — `/fl-pm` sends you a single item whose shape, scope, or goal
isn't settled, plus its detail file. Stay inside that item; a question that belongs to a
sibling item goes back in the report rather than getting resolved here.

## Resolving into work items

Most sessions resolve into one coherent plan. Some expose independent findings that can be
picked up, scheduled, or delegated separately. **A finding is its own work item when it can be
handed to someone carrying no context on the others.** Forcing those into one narrative is
what makes a plan unworkable later.

For each work item, capture:
- the finding or open question;
- why it's independent;
- the dependencies it has or creates, named by work-item title;
- its concrete **next step** — brainstorm, research, prototype, diagnose, decide,
  write-document, create-issues, or implement — with the rationale when the choice isn't
  self-evident.

Pick the next step by **what the item actually lacks**. An item waiting on an external fact
takes research, not another interview.

## Completion

Stop when every decision branch is confirmed and you can state either one coherent plan or a
set of independently actionable work items, each with its next step.

**Report** to `/fl-pm`: the summary, the pinned domain terms, the work items with their next
steps, and any question you deliberately left open with the reason it's still open.

**Handoff:** "Brainstorm resolved into <N> work items. Next: `/fl-pm` to record them and
advance the first. Recommend `/clear` first."
