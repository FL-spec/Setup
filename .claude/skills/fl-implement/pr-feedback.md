# PR feedback loop

Drive **every** open review comment on the PR to a resolved state: each one ends
fixed-and-replied or declined-and-replied, and every thread is marked resolved. You run this in
the main thread. Code and tests still belong to the coder subagent (`coder.md`). **The user
merges.**

## Inputs

The PR number and its branch. Two comment sources feed this loop:
- **Bot reviewers** — the logins listed under `review.bots` in `.sdlc/sdlc-config.yml`. A
  commenting bot that isn't listed → triage it anyway and offer to add it to the config.
- **Findings published by `/fl-pr-review`** — inline comments from the two-axis review, already
  on the PR as review comments.

Both arrive as PR review comments, so one pass covers them.

## 1. Load the PR and its open comments
```bash
gh pr view <N> --json title,body,url,state,headRefName,baseRefName
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null) | {id, user: .user.login, path, line, body}'
```
Top-level comments need triage; skip ones already replied to.

## 2. Get onto the PR's code

Use the issue's existing worktree (`implement.worktree_path`) if there is one; otherwise
`git fetch origin pull/<N>/head:pr-<N>` and check it out. **Only ever add commits** — never
force-push, amend, or rebase the branch.

## 3. Verify each finding against the code

**Take nothing on the reviewer's word.** For each comment:
- Read the referenced file and enough context around it — calling code, the domain model, the
  `specs/<module>.md` contract — to independently confirm the described failure is real.
- Check whether it names a genuinely new defect or an **already-accepted pattern** used
  elsewhere in the same module; that changes the right response.
- Classify it: **confirmed bug (blocking)**, **confirmed non-blocking** (style, minor
  robustness, a nitpick), **confirmed but out of scope or unreachable**, or **not a bug** (the
  reviewer misread the code or spec).

Where a finding is ambiguous and you can't verify it confidently, say so in the reply and ask
the user before resolving that thread.

**The classification decides the board.** At least one confirmed bug, or a non-blocking finding
you'll fix inline → the branch needs a coder round, so board move the issue to `in_progress`
(`SKILL.md`'s Configuration block, including its token-scope fallback) and say so. Everything
declined, deferred, or already tracked → no code changes, so it stays at `in_review`. A review's
findings are **claims** until this step; this is the first point that knows which ones are real.

## 4. Fix the confirmed bugs — coder subagent

Skip this step when triage confirmed nothing that needs code; go straight to the replies.

Otherwise batch the blocking findings (plus any non-blocking ones small enough to fix without
scope creep) and spawn the coder subagent per `coder.md`, giving it the findings, the worktree
path, the issue number, and the relevant quality-gate block(s).

Beyond its brief, require of this round:
- **A regression test per fix**, named for the behavior it pins, failing before and passing after.
- **The docs the fix touches, updated in the same change** — a `specs/<module>.md` contract,
  schema, or §7 Current State that the fix contradicts. Watch
  `wiki/architecture/00-architecture.md`, which no single issue owns; that's the one that drifts.

Then commit describing **what was fixed and why** (not "address PR comments") and push to the
PR's branch.

## 5. Decide the non-fixes

For everything out of scope, unreachable, or not a bug, write the reasoning in one paragraph:
what the risk actually is, why it doesn't apply now (no code path reaches it, it matches an
established pattern, it would deviate from convention for no current benefit), and what would
make it worth revisiting.

Confirmed non-blocking findings get that same scrutiny — low severity doesn't make a real issue
stop mattering. Before deciding each one, check whether it's **already covered**:
`gh issue list --search "<keyword>"`, the PR description's carry-forward notes, and the `wiki/`
planning docs. Already tracked → say so in the reply instead of proposing a duplicate. Real,
untracked, and not worth fixing in this PR → carry it into step 8.

## 6. Reply to every comment

Inline on each thread, **never** as a new top-level PR comment:
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body="<reply>"
```
Fixed → the commit SHA, what changed, the regression test added. Declined → the paragraph from
step 5.

## 7. Resolve the threads

Replies don't auto-resolve, and a thread gets resolved **only after** it has been replied to.
Match each thread by its first comment's `databaseId`:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query { repository(owner: "<owner>", name: "<repo>") { pullRequest(number: <N>) {
  reviewThreads(first: 20) { nodes { id isResolved comments(first: 1) { nodes { databaseId body } } } }
} } }'
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "<thread_id>"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

## 8. Offer to track what's left

Collect every item representing real, actionable work this PR doesn't cover and no existing
issue or doc does: declined-but-real findings, the unfixed non-blocking ones from step 5, and
any carry-forward note already in the PR description. **Ask the user** in one batched question
covering all of them, flagging which you found already tracked so they aren't re-deciding
something settled. On a yes, open each as its own issue — referencing the PR and comment it came
from, labelled per the repo's conventions, and carrying a concrete fix sketch plus acceptance
criteria rather than a restatement of the finding.

## 9. Resolve merge conflicts

Check whether the PR has merge conflicts. If it does, resolve them on the PR branch (merge the
base in; never rebase a pushed branch) and re-run the gates.

## 10. Board and report

If step 3 moved the issue to `in_progress`, every thread now being resolved earns it back: board
move to `in_review`. If it never left, leave it.

**Report**: findings fixed vs. declined vs. non-blocking, the commits pushed, threads resolved,
which findings turned out to be tracked already, any issues opened with links, and the issue's
status. Then **stop** — the user reviews and merges.

Stay scoped to the comments in play; things no reviewer raised belong to a different issue.

**Handoff:** "All <N> threads resolved, PR <url> is green. Merge when ready, then `/fl-pm`
post-merge."
